# Meteor_saydone
A Todo app with timer

Is a mostly a proof of concept. To use Meteor, Angular, Angular Material design and testing out how Typescript works.
Im still using Angular 1.x because of the support that allready exist.

Im using 
- Meteor as base/server
- Angularjs 1.x for the codeing
- Angular material design for GUI
- Angular-material-icons for icons support in Material
- Typescript for scripting
